\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{ch_literature}

Once upon a time engineers and researchers believed... In this area of research, they used the following methods... \cite{Knight2013}

Write this section first as it will take you the longest. I suggest you start writing this as soon as you
have done your initial research at the beginning of your project. You can then return to it once you
have completed your work to edit and adjust it.

A literature review forms the theoretical basis of your project. You need to read a large number of
journal papers, sections in books, technical reports etc. relevant to your work at the start of project.
This will give you a good idea of the field of research.

When writing your review start of with the general concepts and move to the more specific aspects
explaining the necessary theory as you go. This section is NOT a copy and paste from others work or a
rewrite-but-change-one-word section. I suggest you read all your material, and then put it down and
write this section, referring back to the work only when you need to check something.

See your PCS textbook for more details on how to write a literature review.

If you include a figure or a table in your text please see the example in Fig. \ref{fig:model} as to how to caption it.
Please make sure that all text in your figures is readable and that you reference your figures if they are
from another source.

\section{Optics}

\subsection{Brief History}
Optics as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary is "The branch of physics that deals with the properties and phenomena of visible light (and by extension other forms of electromagnetic radiation), sometimes esp. in relation to sight." \cite{oed}.

For most of human history, little was known of the complex phenomena we call light. The first attempts to understand the properties of light were philosophical and history tells us that the Greek philosophers took interest in the subject. Around 300BC Euclid postulated that light propagated in a rectilinear fashion. He also stated the law of reflection. These principles still form part of our understanding of light today. \cite{Vohnsen_2004}

Well before any established scientific theories existed, lenses and their optical properties have been used for visual aid both for visually impaired persons and for magnification of objects. It was however only in the 17th century that the first record of telescopes can be found. Galileo is the first to record the use of such devices for the purpose of scientific inquiry.

In the 17th century scientist Descartes recorded his corpuscular theory of light. This theory was supported and further developed by Newton. In the same century Snell developed what we now know as Snell's law of refraction.

\subsection{Optical Communication}

Optical communication concerns all manors of communicating information from one party to another through the medium of light. This investigation focuses on the use of light as a means of communication between electronic systems, however it is worth noting that optical communication certainly exist outside of this category.

This is where I talk about different IR protocols

\subsection{Manchester Encoding}
Manchester Code is a type of phase encoding. It is classified as a line code and is produced by generating patterns through some measurable phenomena. The commonly used mediums to represent a Manchester encoded signal would be voltage, current and light (electromagnetic radiation).

Manchester coding, as its name suggests, was developed at the University of Manchester and it was first published in 1949 \cite{Jameel2019}. Manchester encoding is a protocol for integrating the clock and data into a single sequence consisting of only two symbols. It does not require clock synchronization, only that a predefined bit-width is known by both the receiver and transmitter. 

The principle behind Manchester code is to encode the information into transitions between two symbols. This technique makes the encoding scheme particularly useful in communication by means of inductive coupling such as in RFID. Due to its self-clocking property and simplicity it is the standard means of encoding for many IR applications. Perhaps the most common application is in the remote controls we use for various appliances.

Manchester code is a special form of binary phase shift keying (BPSK). A square wave of a particular frequency is chosen as the carrier and binary information is encoding by adjusting the setting a phase off set to either 0\degree or 180\degree s. In figure \ref{fig:manchesterencoding} the process of encoding 10 bits is illustrated. Two conventions exist, their difference lies solely in the definition of which logic values are represented by each of the two transitions. The convention used throughout this investigation is in accordance to the IEEE 802.3 standard which defines a logical 1 as the transition from 0 to 1 and a zero as 1 to 0. The other convention used by inventor G.E. Thomas is the inverse of this and is also widely used.\\

\subsubsection{Encoding Algorithm}


\subsubsection{Decoding Algorithm}
Different techniques have been developed to decode Manchester encoded sequences. In his paper on methods for decoding Manchester code, R. A. Dobre discusses an elegant and widely used finite state machine approach which has been illustrated in figure \ref{fig:manchesterdecodingfsm} below. \cite{Dobre2014}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/litreview/manchester_decoding_fsm.png}
	\caption{FSM Algorithm for Decoding Manchester Sequences}
	\label{fig:manchesterdecodingfsm}
\end{figure}

The state machine approach is particularly useful because it only considers the time period between the current detected edge and the previous edge. It removes the need to track samples saving on memory and reducing processing power requirements, all without introducing additional complexity.

It should be noted that this FSM assumes the first bit transmitted is always a logical 1. In addition does not detect the end of a sequence, so additional logic is required such as a counter to detect when a certain number of bits have been received or by means of implementing timeout detection.


\subsection{Error Control}

In information theory, error control is the field of study that concerns issues of detecting errors in digital communications and in certain instances provides the means to corrected these errors. Whenever data is transmitted over some kind of network, there is the possibility that interference can cause a bit to flip resulting in an error. Richard Hamming pioneered in the development of digital error control and is known for (amongst other things) the Hamming code.

\subsubsection{Methods}
Various ways to detect and potentially correct the presence of an error. The most trivial technique known as a 'repetition code' simply involves sending the information three times, making it possible to detect if one of the three data-streams doesn't match the others. Although repetition codes allows for both error detection and correction, it is horribly inefficient. Various techniques have been developed and each technique balances complexity and efficiency.
