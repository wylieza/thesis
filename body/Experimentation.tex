\section{Testing Methodology}

Testing was performed in two phases, the first phase involves testing of individual modules. This modular testing is analogous to unit-tests in the computer programming paradigm. The second phase of testing involves characterising the performance of the final system prototype.

\subsection{Focal Length of Lens}
To generate the beam of light from the IR LED, a light focusing tube was created with a lens as described in the design section. To determine the dimensions of the light focusing tube, the focal length of the lens needed to be measured.

Figure \ref{fig:focal_length_experiemnt} shows the experimental setup used to determine the focal length of the lens. The lens was secured to a pair of 'helping-hands' to allow for precise adjustment of height above the working surface. A light source was placed directly above the lens at a distance of 1.2m.

After setting up the experiment, the lens was slowly adjusted along the vertical until the spot formed on the work surface was a minimum. A tape measure was used to find the distance from the work surface to the lens.

\textbf{Hardware}
\begin{itemize}
	\item IR Power LED:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Beam angle (focus vs no focus)
		\item Beam strength (LUX)
		\item LED Current draw
		\item LED temperature (basic sensor or a temperature gun that I borrow from somewhere)
		\item MOSFET temperature
	\end{itemize}
	\item For each photo-sensor (photodiode, phototransistor, all in one receiver module):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Receiving beam-angle
		\item Output signal strength vs light-intensity/distance
		\item Reaction time (rise time)
		\item multipath/picking up reflections
		\item Signal to noise ration
	\end{itemize}
	\item Op-Amp:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Op-amp gain performance (push to limit) (at 36kHz)
		\item Op-amp frequency performance (at some fixed gain)
