Multiple transmitter beams and multiple narrow field-of view receivers reduce the path loss, multipath distortion, and background noise of the channel, which leads to improved range. We also discuss practical considerations for multielement angle diversity systems, including channel characterization and suboptimal detection techniques. Maximal-ratio combining provides nearly optimal performance up to 100 Mb/s for the angle diversity systems considered. The design and performance of a prototype angle diversity IR communication system are discussed. The prototype can maintain 70 Mb/s at a P/sub e/ of 10/sup -9/ over a 4-m range.},

MSM optical communications systems using subcarrier signal point sequences (SSPS) that can improve the power efficiency of MSM systems are also explained. The performance of MSM optical communications systems is presented in the intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) channel without dispersion and in atmospheric optical communications where the effects of scintillation exist.},

Advantages and drawbacks of the infrared medium are compared to those of radio and microwave media. The physical characteristics of infrared channels using intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) are presented including path losses and multipath responses. Natural and artificial ambient infrared noise sources are characterized. Strategies for designs of transmitter and receivers that maximize link signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are described. Several modification formats are discussed in detail, including on-off keying (OOK) pulse-position modulation (PPM), and subcarrier modulation. The performance of these techniques in the presence of multipath distortion is quantified. Techniques for multiplexing the transmissions of different users are reviewed. The performance of an experimental 50-Mb/s on-off-keyed diffuse infrared link is described.},

It is the RC5 protocol. This was to implement and demonstrate this RC5 protocol and use it to control three to four devices. We have chosen to use FPGA to process the information. In this work we implemented RC5 protocol and used this protocol to control and operate some beginner level devices like stepper motor, 7-segment display, shift register. We identified and explored the features and advantages of VHDL programming language and implemented this protocol on two Xilinx FPGA boards out of which one was a transmitter and another was a receiver to which the targets were interfaced. We have to be demonstrated the way to achieve synchronization between two FPGA boards by systematically dividing the clock on both the boards.},

The clock signal can be recovered at the reception point and the transmission line can be driven with a signal that contains no DC component. Its simplicity makes it a preferred code to be used in IR communications. RC5 is a protocol that uses Manchester coding. Using it, wireless communications can be easily implemented with cost efficient systems, if the IR communication constraints, represented mainly by line of sight and distance, are met. The Manchester encoded sequences can be decoded in many ways.

abstract = {Digital signal processing (DSP) is one of the most powerful technologies which will shape the science, engineering and technology of the twenty-first century. Since 1970, revolutionary changes took place in the broad area of DSP which has made it an essential tool in many engineering applications. Digital filter is considered to be one of the most important components of almost every DSP sub-systems and therefore a number of extensive works had been carried out by researchers on the design of such filter. In order to meet the stringent requirements of filter specification, order of the designed filter is generally assumed to be very large and this leads to high power and area consumption during their implementation. As a matter of fact, design of hardware efficient digital filter has drawn enormous attention which needs to be addressed by various useful means. One popular approach has been to encode the tap coefficients of such filter in the form of sum of signed powers-of-two and thus the operation of multiplication is substituted by simple addition and shifting. This paper presents a detailed review of the basic design approaches applicable for the synthesis of hardware efficient finite duration impulse response (FIR) filter. Both the traditional and heuristic search algorithms have been incorporated and properly arranged in this review.},
