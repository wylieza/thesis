@article{Vohnsen_2004,
abstract = {The science of optics stems from the roots of western civilisation and has since then served as a prime source of inspiration for a number of distinguished scientists working towards improving our knowledge about light, colour and the process of vision. In this contribution major steps in the evolution of the intriguing science of optics are described including the various theories that consider light to consist of rays, particles, electromagnetic waves, and lastly a dual nature of light that show both particle and wave characteristics. In route the description includes several of the main players in constructing our present-day understanding of light.},
