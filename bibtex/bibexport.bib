abstract = {The work mainly concentrates to create a remote controlled environment to address every device with a unique ID. To address this issue we are in need of a protocol. It is the RC5 protocol. This was to implement and demonstrate this RC5 protocol and use it to control three to four devices. We have chosen to use FPGA to process the information. In this work we implemented RC5 protocol and used this protocol to control and operate some beginner level devices like stepper motor, 7-segment display, shift register. We identified and explored the features and advantages of VHDL programming language and implemented this protocol on two Xilinx FPGA boards out of which one was a transmitter and another was a receiver to which the targets were interfaced. We have to be demonstrated the way to achieve synchronization between two FPGA boards by systematically dividing the clock on both the boards.},

@inproceedings{Dobre2014,
abstract = {The Manchester code, also known as Phase Encoding, is a popular line code, offering many advantages and in the same time being very simple to understand and implement. The clock signal can be recovered at the reception point and the transmission line can be driven with a signal that contains no DC component. Its simplicity makes it a preferred code to be used in IR communications. RC5 is a protocol that uses Manchester coding. Using it, wireless communications can be easily implemented with cost efficient systems, if the IR communication constraints, represented mainly by line of sight and distance, are met. The Manchester encoded sequences can be decoded in many ways. Some of largely used methods and another two imagined by the author are presented in this paper, with embedded systems oriented flow diagrams for easy implementation.},

@misc{Chandra2016,
abstract = {Digital signal processing (DSP) is one of the most powerful technologies which will shape the science, engineering and technology of the twenty-first century. Since 1970, revolutionary changes took place in the broad area of DSP which has made it an essential tool in many engineering applications. Digital filter is considered to be one of the most important components of almost every DSP sub-systems and therefore a number of extensive works had been carried out by researchers on the design of such filter. In order to meet the stringent requirements of filter specification, order of the designed filter is generally assumed to be very large and this leads to high power and area consumption during their implementation. As a matter of fact, design of hardware efficient digital filter has drawn enormous attention which needs to be addressed by various useful means. One popular approach has been to encode the tap coefficients of such filter in the form of sum of signed powers-of-two and thus the operation of multiplication is substituted by simple addition and shifting. This paper presents a detailed review of the basic design approaches applicable for the synthesis of hardware efficient finite duration impulse response (FIR) filter. Both the traditional and heuristic search algorithms have been incorporated and properly arranged in this review.},

In this contribution major steps in the evolution of the intriguing science of optics are described including the various theories that consider light to consist of rays, particles, electromagnetic waves, and lastly a dual nature of light that show both particle and wave characteristics. In route the description includes several of the main players in constructing our present-day understanding of light.},
